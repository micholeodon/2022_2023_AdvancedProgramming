### MEETING nr 2 (31.03.2023)

**Exercise 1. Calculator**. The program allows you to enter two real numbers and perform four operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, corresponding to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program calculates four results of all the operations performed on the two numbers specified by the user and displays them.

Operation scheme:

1. The program asks for the first number,
    
1. The program asks for the second number,
    
1. The program shows what operations it will perform,
    
1. The program calculates four results,
    
1. The program display each result.
    
1. Important! Program should detect division by zero and inform politely the user about this fact.
	
	

**Exercise 2. Find x**. The program is to find the solution of the equation `ax + b = c`. The parameters `a`, `b`, `c` are given by the user. Let the program run as follows:

1. First, it will display the text "ax + b = c".

2. Then it will ask the user to specify the real numbers a, b, c.

3. It will display the equation "ax + b = c" with the substituted numerical values.

4. The program calculates the value of x.

5. Will display the result.
