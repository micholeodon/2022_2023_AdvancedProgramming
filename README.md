### MEETING nr 4 (28.04.2023)

**Exercise 1. Parrot**. The program allows you to enter some text and then it writes it to a `parrot.txt` file (created if needed).

Operation scheme:

1. The program asks for some input text,
    
1. The program prints the text on the screen,
    
1. The program writes the text to a `parrot.txt` file, which should be placed inside the script's directory.	


**Exercise 2. Movies**

The program that saves user data into a CSV file - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values

1. Program asks for a number of data records user want to enter (positive integer; number of rows in the file),
1. Next user inputs: movie name, 
1. Next user inputs: numerical value from 1.0 to 10.0,
1. Two requests above are repeated as many times as the number of rows,
1. All the data is saved in `movies.csv`, 
1. At the end, the content of the file is displayed on the screen.
1. Example content:

```
No.,Title,Rating
1,Inception,8.3
2,Room,2.9
3,Matrix,7.6
4,Pianist,8.3
5,Dune,7.7
6,Paterson,7.1
```

### MEETING nr 2 (31.03.2023)

**Exercise 1. Calculator**. The program allows you to enter two real numbers and perform four operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, corresponding to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program calculates four results of all the operations performed on the two numbers specified by the user and displays them.

Operation scheme:

1. The program asks for the first number,
    
1. The program asks for the second number,
    
1. The program shows what operations it will perform,
    
1. The program calculates four results,
    
1. The program display each result.
    
1. Important! Program should detect division by zero and inform politely the user about this fact.
	
	

**Exercise 2. Find x**. The program is to find the solution of the equation `ax + b = c`. The parameters `a`, `b`, `c` are given by the user. Let the program run as follows:

1. First, it will display the text "ax + b = c".

2. Then it will ask the user to specify the real numbers a, b, c.

3. It will display the equation "ax + b = c" with the substituted numerical values.

4. The program calculates the value of x.

5. Will display the result.
